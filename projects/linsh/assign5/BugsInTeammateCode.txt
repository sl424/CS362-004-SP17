Yes.


Description
===========
In my testing, I played the smithy to draw 3 cards but only 2 new cards shows up
in hand and the deck count is incorrect as well.



Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------

These are the steps for setting up the test:

    /* set hand */
    handpos = 0;
    G.hand[thisPlayer][handpos] = smithy;
    newCards = 3;
    discarded = 1;

    // copy the game state to a test case
    memcpy(&testG, &G, sizeof(struct gameState));
    cardEffect(smithy, choice1, choice2, choice3, &testG, handpos, &bonus);

When compare the new state against the expected state. The test shows 1 card
missing. 

Expected Results
----------------
hand count = 6, expected = 7... Error
deck count = 3, expected = 2... Error




Actual Results
--------------
hand count = 6, expected = 7... Error
deck count = 3, expected = 2... Error
