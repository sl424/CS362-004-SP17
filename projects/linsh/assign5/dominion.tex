\homeworkSection{Re-factoring}
Using my team's tauqirs' dominion code, I didn't have to change the test itself
to run. However, there are many calls that will break if the array structure or
data structure change. \\

For instance, to set up the test for mine card, I have to manually set the hand
cards and deck cards in order to run the tests. If tarqirs change the struct or
how the array in the hand or deck are set up, the test would not be able to run. 
This is also the case when I'm assert and check if the test pass or fail. \\

The best way is to create some interface calls to change the hand card or deck
card through some function calls so that the test program does not need to know
about the data structure used. It's better to use something like the cardEffect
wrapper call which doesn't need to change. \\

\homeworkSection{Bug-Reports}
\texttt{Smithy}:
The first bug filed is smithy. The code failed the test to see whether the
player has drawn 3 new cards to his hand.
For example, with a full hand, after drawing 3 cards and discard the smithy card, the player
should end up with 7 cards, instead, it shows 6 cards only. The program did not
crash or return with errors so it could be some sort index error and return
prematurely. After checking out code, it appears that the for loop condition
should be 3 and not 2. \\

\lstinputlisting{smithybug.txt}
\lstinputlisting{BugsInTeammateCode.txt}


\texttt{mine}:
This was an interesting bug because it passes some test but failed at others. It
appears that when you trade copper or silver for higher value card, it is ok.
But whenever it is trade for something of equal value or less, it fails. At
first, it looks like maybe that's what the card should do but the official rule
does not block trading for equal or less value card. This could be due to some
bug when comparing the two card values. In the source code, it appears that the
second cannot be less than the first card or it will fail. 

\lstinputlisting{minebug.txt}
\lstinputlisting{BugsInTeammateCode2.txt}


\homeworkSection{Debugging}
\texttt{smithy}:
In my own dominion code, I'm  debuggint the smithy call as well. The test for this one
is simple but the error is different from my teammate. 
This bug appears not to draw no new card at all, Instead of expected hand count
of 7, i have only 4 cards in hand. 

\lstinputlisting{smithy-bugfix.txt}

In order to debug this, I have created several breakpoints and watchpoints. By
doing that I can see if how the hand cards change. Other breakpoints include
cardEffect and play\_smithy, watch for draw card loop index. 

\lstinputlisting{bk.txt}

In the case, I can see that
the smithy was played and discarded  when play\_smithy begins by playing 
the smithy card at handPos=0. The handCount watch point was reflect the new
change. But it didn't show any change to the hand from drawing new card.\\

After rerun the debugger, I have also set watchpoints for index i value. If the
loop stops this would help show me why. At first the i integer set to 0 as
expected but it did not step into the loop, instead, it proceeds to discarding
the smithy card. Looking at line 697 of the code, it becomes clear that the loop
condition is wrong and it exits too soon. \\

\lstinputlisting{debug.txt}

After fixing the loop condition, rerunning the test shows that it has passed the
tests. With the debugger, I can see that it has stepped through the loop this
time, adding a new card to hand each time. \\

%	PROBLEM 1
%-----------------------------------------
% To have just one problem per page, simply put a \clearpage after each problem
%----------------------------------------
\begin{homeworkProblem}
	1. List 3 different protocols that appear in the protocol column in 
	the unfiltered packet-listing window in step 7 above.
\lstinputlisting{summary.txt}
There are tcp, http, and tls protocols in the unfiltered packet.
\end{homeworkProblem}

%	PROBLEM 2
\begin{homeworkProblem}
	2. How long did it take from when the HTTP GET message was sent until the HTTP
OK reply was received? 
	\begin{verbatim}
The request was sent at 0.08 and returns at 0.17, the time taken is 0.09
	seconds.
	\end{verbatim}

\end{homeworkProblem}


%Problem 3
\begin{homeworkProblem}
	3. What is the Internet address of the gaia.cs.umass.edu (also known as www-
net.cs.umass.edu)?  What is the Internet address of your computer?

	\texttt{ gaia.cs.umass.edu = 128.119.245.12}\\

	\texttt{ source ip = 172.31.98.135}

\end{homeworkProblem}

%Problem 4
\begin{homeworkProblem}
	4. Screenshot the two HTTP messages (GET and OK) referred to in question 2
above. Make sure to include all pertinent information in the screenshot (Time
field, Internet addresses, etc). Paste these screenshots into your lab report.
