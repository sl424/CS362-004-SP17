Description
===========
I set up the unit test to trade copper, silver, and gold. The
card failed when trading copper for copper. It works if it's copper to silver
and silver to gold. This is a minor annoyance since most poeple use it to get
higher value treasure card anyway. 


Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
We set the hand so that we can play the mine card with the choice of treasure
card in hand position 0 and 1. 

        /* set hand  and deck*/
        handpos = 0;
        G.hand[thisPlayer][handpos] = mine;
        choice1 = 1;
        G.hand[thisPlayer][choice1] = treasure_cards[i];
        choice2 = treasure_cards[j];

        newCards = 1;
        trashed = 1;
        played = 1;
        xtraCoins = 0;

        // copy the game state to a test case
        memcpy(&testG, &G, sizeof(struct gameState));
        rv = cardEffect(mine, choice1, choice2, choice3, &testG, handpos, &bonus);

When we compare the result, trading for treasure card of the same or less value
will return with error. 

Expected Results/  Actual Results
----------------
*** trade treasure card 4 for 4
return status = -1, expected = 0... Error
hand count = 5, expected = 4... Error
new card = 11, expected = 4 ... Error
supply count = 46, expected = 45... Error
mine discarded: card = 11, NOT = 11... Error

*** trade treasure card 4 for 5
return status = 0, expected = 0... OK
hand count = 4, expected = 4... OK
new card = 5, expected = 5 ... OK
supply count = 39, expected = 39... OK
mine discarded: card = 5, NOT = 11... OK

** trade treasure card 4 for 6
return status = 0, expected = 0... OK
hand count = 4, expected = 4... OK
new card = 6, expected = 6 ... OK
supply count = 29, expected = 29... OK
mine discarded: card = 6, NOT = 11... OK

Workarounds
-----------
only trade for higher value treasure cards
